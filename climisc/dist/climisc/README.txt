Hi all, naaboo here. Join our Discord pl0x.


HOW_TO_RUN:
1) click 'climisc.exe'

COMMANDS:
1) Numbers 0-9 TO selects thread (ex. 15).
2) On homepage, Z/C refreshes, X exits the program.
3) On thread, Z displays 2nd page (if one exists), 
X does nothing, C goes to homepage.

Issues: on 2nd page you can't do anything but close program, lol.
Easy fix but don't feel like fixing atm.
